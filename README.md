# Mapping the Bakken (aka Dakota Access) Pipeline

This is the github repo for the Bakken Pipeline Map:
https://bakkenpipelinemap.com/

It contains the original sources of data, and the data that has been generated.



## Sources
### Iowa
- The pipeline has been mostly constructed in all states. Construction progress is only known in Iowa, and is updated weekly. Here is one mapping document, all of which are available through the Iowa Utilities Board (IUB):
https://efs.iowa.gov/cs/groups/external/documents/docket/mdax/nja1/~edisp/1605928.pdf

- A report claiming that the pipeline is mostly complete in other states. As of 11/18/2016, the status has not changed; Dakota Access has not claimed it to be complete in any state:

- Properties crossing and eminent domain

- Propery owners in lawsuit with Dakota Access. These are included in the map of properties.
There were 17 landowners involved in the lawsuit at the time of this document, who owned 46 properties.
The data was produced once from this document, and a new document is produced every week for the IUB:

Note: Story, Boone, Polk, and Keokuk counties used GIS data from the county asessors.

## Generated Data
This will have the shapefiles of map data (pipeline, facilities, properties), and the georeferenced tiffs. Should be around a gigabyte, will upload soon.
